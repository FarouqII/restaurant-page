# Restaurant Page

A simple, dynamic restaurant homepage built to put into practice key concepts learned: **Webpack**, automation, and **dynamic loading**.

---

## Overview

This project is a minimal restaurant webpage that dynamically generates content using JavaScript modules. It showcases:

- Using **Webpack** to bundle assets and enable modular JS
- **Automated builds** and development workflows
- **Dynamic loading** of page sections via JavaScript to improve organization and modularity

---

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** modules (ES6 imports/exports) for modular page components
- **Webpack** for bundling, with configurations supporting loaders, dev server, and build scripts
- **Automation** via npm scripts (`build`, `start`, etc.) to streamline development and deployment
- Dynamic DOM manipulation to render content based on user interaction (e.g., tabbed navigation)

---

## What I Learned
- **Webpack configuration**: Learned how to configure bundling, loaders, and dev server options.

- **Automation**: Utilized npm scripts (start, build) to simplify workflows.

- **Dynamic Loading**: Implemented page switching using JavaScript modules that dynamically render content into the DOM.

- **Code Organization**: Separated each page into its module, making the structure cleaner and more maintainable.
